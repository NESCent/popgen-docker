# Docker image for Population Genetics in R

This image is intended to provide commonly used R packages for population genetic analysis on top of a comprehensive R image. The Dockerfile is monitored and automatically rebuilt upon changes at Docker Hub as [hlapp/rpopgen]. 

This project originated from the [Population Genetics in R Hackathon] held at [NESCent] in March 2015, specifically from the [Workflow Vignettes Community Website] project.
